## Script and Simulink file to generate Random Road Profile based on PSD (Power Spectral Density)

## This code was written thanks to the book :
# Road Vehicle Dynamics : Fundamentals and modeling with Matlab
# Rill, Georg (2nd edition, 2020)

To use the script simply enter the parameters in the file (RandomRoadProfile.m)
and run it.

To use the Simulink model (RoadProfile.slx) double click on the road block to
enter the parameters. The output will be observed on the scope.
